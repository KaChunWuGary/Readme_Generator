## Description
This application is used to speed up the creation of a readme file. It uses the command terminal for the user to input information and then creates a readme.md file based on the information. It will then generate a premade template with that information.

You must download the package.json, which contains the files needed for inquirer. Inquirer is used to get information in the command terminal. As far as this is tested, npm is used to install the files needed. 
          
## Usage <a id='l_usage'></a>
In the command terminal, type "npm install". After downloading is finished, then type "node index.js". Fill the information needed, and the reamdme should be created.
